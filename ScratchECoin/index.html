This page AJAXes <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" title="Scratch"> Scratch </a> which is a project by MIT's Lifelong Kindergarten Group.
<br/>Ok, so there is nothing here at the moment (A. T. M. in text-talk) but I am testing how Scratch handles AJAX from sites outside of Scratch, especially using the API
<br/>This site will not likely not ork with IE, so sorry about that <code>:(</code>
<script>
var x = new XMLHttpRequest();
x.onreadystatechange = function(){if(x.status==200&&x.readyState==4){console.log(x.responseText)}}
x.open("GET", "https://scratch.mit.edu/varserver/111774227", true);
x.send();
